# Question

Where do html attributes go?

# Answer

The attribute goes inside the state <> of the tag or element, and a space after the name to the tag or element. Kinda of like <html_nameOfTag attribute=""></html_nameOfTag>.

Yup! In the future you can refer to the "start" tag as the opening tag and use actual html elements, in this case you could have use the a tag or img tag!
